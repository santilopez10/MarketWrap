                    <div class="mainTeaserA">The International Monetary Fund predicted the “Great Lockdown” recession would be the steepest in almost a century and warned the world economy’s contraction and recovery would be worse than anticipated if the coronavirus lingers or returns.<br><br>
                        In its first World Economic Outlook report since the spread of the virus and subsequent freezing of major economies, the IMF estimated on Tuesday that global gross domestic product will shrink 3% this year.<br><br>                        
                        That compares to a January projection of 3.3% expansion and would likely mark the deepest dive since the Great Depression...</div>

                    <div class="sideTeaserA">Oil dropped to its lowest level in more than 18 years on Wednesday amid reports suggesting persistent oversupply and collapsing demand due to global coronavirus-related lockdowns could continue to hammer prices.<br><br>
                        The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday forecast a 29 million barrel per day (bpd) dive in April oil demand to levels not seen in 25 years and said no output cut could fully offset the near-term falls facing the market.<br><br>
                        Brent crude fell $1.91, or 6.45%, to settle at $27.69, giving up an earlier gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 24 cents, or 1.19%, to settle at $19.87 per barrel, its lowest settle since Feb. 2002.</div>

                    <div class="altTeaserA">In an unprecedented collaborative move, Google and Apple are working together to develop a novel smartphone-based system that can help identify those who have been in proximity to someone with COVID-19. The Bluetooth-based technology will begin rolling out on both iOS and Android devices from mid-May.<br><br>
                        With most of the world in lockdown, subject to severe stay-at-home orders, many are asking how we can re-emerge without suffering subsequent viral outbreaks. Contact tracing will be a vital technique...</div>
