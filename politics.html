                    <div class="mainTeaserA">American, Delta, and eight other airlines struck a deal with the U.S. Treasury Department on a rescue package worth billions of dollars on Tuesday.<br><br>
                        Airlines are set to receive grants worth $22.7 billion—90% of the $25 billion in grants allocated to passenger airlines in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act—known as the Cares Act. Airlines can still tap $25 billion in government loans (if they can’t get private financing). And the cash infusion should prevent layoffs until at least the fall, when it is hoped air traffic recovers.</div>

                    <div class="sideTeaserA">On Jan. 22, two days after Chinese officials first publicized the serious threat posed by the new virus ravaging the city of Wuhan, the chief of the World Health Organization held the first of what would be months of almost daily media briefings, sounding the alarm, telling the world to take the outbreak seriously.<br><br>
                        But with its officials divided, the W.H.O., still seeing no evidence of sustained spread of the virus outside of China, declined the next day to declare a global public health emergency. A week later, the organization reversed course and made the declaration. Those early days of the epidemic illustrated the strengths and weaknesses of the W.H.O...</div>

                        The toolbox, which has been developed by the e-Health Network with the support of the Commission, is intended as a practical guide to implementing digital tools for tracking close contacts between device carriers as a proxy for infection risk that seeks to steer Member States in a common, privacy-sensitive direction as they configure their digital responses to the COVID-19 pandemic...</div>
